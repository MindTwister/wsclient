wsclient
========

A wrapper for go's [go.net/websocket](http://go.net/websocket)

The project aims to simplify websocket handling in the spirit of socket.io.

The project is considered early alpha and adopters should expect interfaces to be working, but in flux.

For documentation and examples see `wsclient_example_test.go` and `wsclient_test.go` and the [documentation at godoc.org](http://godoc.org/github.com/MindTwister/wsclient)

I will attempt to never push versions with less than 95% test coverage, keep this in mind if you wish to contribute.
